# PDF_Remove_IDs
I personally created this in order to process my USAMO 2025 scans, but thought this would be useful for others too.

# What this does
This creates a rectangle at the top left of each page in your PDF, saves the pages as images, then saves the images back to a PDF. This essentially removes your MAA ID from your PDF.

# Usage
Just run `editor.py`.
